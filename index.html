<h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Data and Free Speech</h1>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"Should there be a distinction in the rights to collect and disseminate data depending on the form of the data? That is, should the right to collect and disseminate photographs, audio, or video be the same as the right to collect and disseminate text?"</p>


<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Free speech, once a relatively simple subject of discussions, has experienced many reconsiderations as the age of information changed the way we deal with ideas of what we should tolerate the spread of. The spread of information, once centralized in printing houses, and later broadcasting and television companies, is now trivially possible for almost any citizen of the united states, and the capture of images is far easier too with phones being a practically essential commodity. It’s important to remember that the founding fathers, when creating the laws that would govern our land, lived in an era where “speech” was referring to either the literal act of speaking in a public or private space, or the publication of printed material. Epistemically, both of these have a great many checks and balances on what is possible to spread: in the first case, what you claim is inherently linked to the person claiming it, and there are few who are unable to distinguish between a claim by a person and the material evidence required to know if that claim is true. In the other, the spread is limited by access to a printing press, which requires trust by at least one person with capital to stake on their reputation, and if you truly want to get your words out into the word, it requires publishing them in an existing paper that many individuals buy- again, centralizing the spread and allowing for easy(er) tracking of the origin of sources. The same was true of radio and television- there were only so many channels, and they were all controlled by companies with an expressed interest in not misleading their userbase. However, there were still instances where this did come to pass- for instance, Orson Wells infamous War Of The Worlds broadcast, which created a significant panic in response to his claims of martian invasion. However, even this pales to what has become possible with the internet. Photoshop has long been used to spread misleading images, and video editing has created some incredibly convincing hoaxes. However, these often take considerable effort, and the ability of the general population to spread information about their falsification generally kept pace with the supply. However, artificial intelligence may soon change this, turning the production of misleading and often dangerous images and even videos a matter of seconds instead of days. Additionally, these tools remove skill barriers from the process, and the lack of a specific creator’s touch means that tracking down the origin can be next to impossible. A case such as this was seen recently in the news: A teacher created a audio file of the principal of his school yelling bigotries, something almost unthinkable even a few years ago. Many, presented with what seemed like obvious proof, ignored the accused’s claims of innocence- a completely reasonable response, observing how sudden these changes have been. It is completely reasonable to claim, given all this, that video and audio, especially those created by AI, must be regulated in order to keep events such as these from happening again.
